    Skip t/pod_file_ok.t external section test if Scalar::Util is before
    1.40. The problem is that before that version the section linked to
    does not exist, and the test fails. Thanks to Slaven Rezić (SREZIC),
    whose tester uncovered the need for this.

    Test all_pod_files_ok against t/data, not blib/. The issue here is
    that of the previous paragraph.

    Have t/pod_file_ok.t dump configuration info.

    Fail links to installed-but-undocumented modules. Thanks to Andreas
    J. König (ANDK), whose tester uncovered the need for this.

    Correct the documented "coreness" of Pod::Simple::SimpleTree. I had
    it non-core, but it is actually part of Pod::Simple, which is core.

    Add paragraph line number to generated test names. This triggered a
    refactor of the test message generator.
