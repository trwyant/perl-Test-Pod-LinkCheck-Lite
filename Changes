    Fix noise in xt/author/perlpod.t.

    Add new() argument add_dir to cover links to odd places.
    The default is blib/script to cover links into script files.

    Add user_agent argument to new().  This allows the user to specify a
    subclass of HTTP::Tiny, to implement extra client functionality such
    as a persistent cache, Thanks to Graham (plicease) for letting me
    know of the need for this, and working with me on the
    implementation.

    Ignore text in X<...> tags. Rendering the text was preventing the
    proper identification of link targets. Thanks to Zaki Mughal
    (zmughal) for recognizing the problem, fixing it, submitting the
    pull request, and rattling my cage when I (for some unknown reason)
    did not respond to his original request.

    If IO::Socket::SSL is missing, https: links generate skipped tests,
    with a diagnostic for the first one skipped.  Thanks to Mark Gardner
    (mjgardner) for pointing out the need for this.

    Localize $_ before while (<>).

0.009		2022-09-11	T. R. Wyant
    Add canned 'ignore_url' value MAYBE_IGNORE_GITHUB.  This causes
    GitHub URLs to be ignored unless the source directory contains a Git
    repository and GitHub is configured as a remote.  This is intended
    to be useful to authors whose boiler plate contains GitHub links, in
    the early stages of the project before the GitHub repository has
    been created.

    Provide fake modules for testing to prevent test failures on systems
    that have stripped POD from core modules.

    Cache URL responses, for performance and to minimize hits on sites.
    This is controlled by the Boolesn cache_url_response attribute,
    which defaults to true.

    Correct generation of 'provides' metadata.  Thanks to Favio Poletti
    for blogging
    https://github.polettix.it/ETOOBUSY/2021/06/15/the-real-pause-workaround/,
    and ultimately to Joel Berger for the pointer to
    https://metacpan.org/pod/CPAN::Meta::Spec#no_index

    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    Get prerequisites up to snuff and add xt/author/prereq.t to ensure
    they stay that way.

0.006		2021-01-16	T. R. Wyant
    Add Travis CI testing.

    Use GitHub as bug tracker. R.I.P. rt.cpan.org.

    Skip man tests if 'man -w man' can not be executed. Thanks to Alceu
    Rodrigues de Freitas Junior, whose OpenBSD smoker picked this up.

    Optionally fail URL links that redirect. The user can provide code
    to determine which redirections are allowed.

0.003		2019-08-30	T. R. Wyant
    Fix test of link to extant-but-undocumented module. The result now
    contains the failing link and line number, and a passing test for
    the entire file is NOT generated.

0.002		2019-08-04	T. R. Wyant
    Skip URL links with server (5xx) errors.  This is controlled by
    Boolean attribute skip_server_errors, which is true by default.  The
    default behaviour is a change from version 0.001, which generated a
    failed test in this case. The logic (if any) is that status 5xx can
    represent an actual server error rather than an incorrect link.

    First production release
