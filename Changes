    Cache URL responses, for performance and to minimize hits on sites.
    This is controlled by the Boolesn cache_url_response attribute,
    which defaults to true.

    Correct generation of 'provides' metadata.  Thanks to Favio Poletti

    Add rt.cpan.org back to bug reporting methods. Long live RT!

    they stay that way.

    Optionally fail URL links that redirect. The user can provide code
    to determine which redirections are allowed.

    Fix test of link to extant-but-undocumented module. The result now
    contains the failing link and line number, and a passing test for
    the entire file is NOT generated.

    Skip URL links with server (5xx) errors.  This is controlled by
    Boolean attribute skip_server_errors, which is true by default.  The
    default behaviour is a change from version 0.001, which generated a
    failed test in this case. The logic (if any) is that status 5xx can
    represent an actual server error rather than an incorrect link.
