    Remove 'ua' attribute. Since HTTP::Tiny is a prerequisite we can
    always have a user agent. Analysis control goes into the new *_url
    attributes:

    Add Boolean attribute 'check_url', which controls whether or not URL
    links are checked.

    Add attribute 'ignore_url', which allows matching URLs to be ignored
    even if URLs are being checked.

    Add attribute 'agent', which specifies the user agent string sent
    when checking URL links.

    Remove 'strict' attribute. Anything which can not be checked is now
    skipped.

    Add tests for bugs reported against other POD link testers.

    Methods pod_file_ok() and all_pod_files_ok() now return failures,
    passes, and skipped tests if called in list context.

    Add eg/README.

    Section scan was ignoring sections that started with a format code.

    Add -dump to eg/test-pod-links.

    Rename eg/test-pod to eg/test-pod-links

    Fix recursion bug triggered by C<0>. The problem was testing for
    truth rather than definedness. A false (but defined) POD element
    caused the extraction of POD elements to restart from the root.

    Correct handling of section defs with formatting such as (actual
    example) =head2 charnames::vianame(I<name>)
