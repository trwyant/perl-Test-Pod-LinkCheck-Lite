    Pre-emptively default 'man' to false under MSWin32 and DOS. This is
    because ReactOS actually has a MAN.EXE which is unsuitable.

    Note beginning and end of all_pod_files_ok() tests

    Fix test failure with old Scalar::Util. When I split the test POD
    files into t/data/pod_ok/ and t/data/not_ok/ I forgot that
    external_installed_section.pod failed if Scalar::Util was old
    enough. Or actually I remembered enough to skip the unit test, but
    then all_pod_files_ok() found it anyway and failed it.

    Recognize =item as defining a section

    Normalize links and sections.

    Have all_pod_files_ok() also check .pod files. This involved a
    refactor of the .pod files from t/data into t/data/pod_ok (valid
    POD) and t/data/not_ok (invalid POD) so that all_pod_files_ok()
    would pass.
    
    Also eliminated some dead code.
    
    Interesting what happens when you look at your test coverage and start
    asking questions.

    Prohibit spaces in man page links because FreeBSD can not check them
    properly.

    Add attribute allow_man_spaces to allow them again.

    Add convenience method configuration().

    Fix test for link to non-existent man page.

    Remake mocked data under Storable 2.04 because that is what ships
    with Perl 5.8.0. This turned out to be a problem when testing under
    5.8.4.

    Tweak man link testing: Skip correct number of tests if we can't do
    man page tests; Skip the bad link test if our contrived bad manpage
    turns out to be good after all.

    Fix man link bug: bad links were reported as skip because
    ICP::Cmd::run was returning undef on failure rather than a
    defined-but-false value, and my logic took undef to mean that the
    check could not be done.

    Add DESCRIPTION paragraph with recommended use as an author testing
    module only.

    Add ACKNOWLEDGMENTS section to POD.

    Address test failures with Pod::Simple < 3.24. The problem was that
    'man' links were being misclassified as 'pod' links. Rather than
    require Pod::Simple 3.24 I lifted the regex from that version.

    Add accessor for ignore_url attribute.

    Correct external installed section test. I wanted to skip it if
    Scalar::Util's version was less than 1.40, but I did not read the
    documentation for Module::Load::Conditional::check_install()
    attentively enough.

    Add check_external_sections, require_installed as attributes, with
    same-named accessor methods.

    Report actual line numbers of links (I hope). This involved
    changing out the parser. Instead of using ::SimpleTree and rummaging
    through the parse, I used ::PullParser and collected information as
    I went. With preserve_whitespace() set true, I can infer the line
    number of the link from the starting line of the paragraph it is
    embedded in by counting line breaks.

    Skip t/pod_file_ok.t external section test if Scalar::Util is before
    1.40. The problem is that before that version the section linked to
    does not exist, and the test fails. Thanks to Slaven Rezić (SREZIC),
    whose tester uncovered the need for this.

    Test all_pod_files_ok against t/data, not blib/. The issue here is
    that of the previous paragraph.

    Have t/pod_file_ok.t dump configuration info.

    Fail links to installed-but-undocumented modules. Thanks to Andreas
    J. König (ANDK), whose tester uncovered the need for this.

    Correct the documented "coreness" of Pod::Simple::SimpleTree. I had
    it non-core, but it is actually part of Pod::Simple, which is core.

    Add paragraph line number to generated test names. This triggered a
    refactor of the test message generator.

    First CPAN release.
