    Skip man tests if 'man -w man' can not be executed. Thanks to Alceu
    Rodrigues de Freitas Junior, whose OpenBSD smoker picked this up.

    Optionally fail URL links that redirect. The user can provide code
    to determine which redirections are allowed.

    Fix test of link to extant-but-undocumented module. The result now
    contains the failing link and line number, and a passing test for
    the entire file is NOT generated.

    Skip URL links with server (5xx) errors.  This is controlled by
    Boolean attribute skip_server_errors, which is true by default.  The
    default behaviour is a change from version 0.001, which generated a
    failed test in this case. The logic (if any) is that status 5xx can
    represent an actual server error rather than an incorrect link.
