    Rename eg/test-por to eg/test-pod-links

    Fix recursion bug triggered by C<0>. The problem was testing for
    truth rather than definedness. A false (but defined) POD element
    caused the extraction of POD elements to restart from the root.

    Correct handling of section defs with formatting such as (actual
    example) =head2 charnames::vianame(I<name>)
