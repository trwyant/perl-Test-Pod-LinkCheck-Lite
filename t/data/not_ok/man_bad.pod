=pod

The following is a random 64-character command name generated from
characters in the set [0-9A-Za-z_-]. My previous try was 'bad cmd',
which did not work as advertized under FreeBSD. Under that OS, the
argument appeard to be split on space by C<man -w>, and since C<man> is
a valid manpage, the returned status was 0. If you change this, make
sure constant RANDOM_CMD in t/pod_file_ok.t is changed to match.
