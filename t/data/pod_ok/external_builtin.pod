=pod

This POD contains a link to a built-in command, L<unlink|unlink>.

NOTE that the test for proper handling of XE<lt>...E<gt> was expanded
and moved to F<xt/author/perlpod.t>, since it made reference to POD over
which I had no control. I am very grateful to Zaki Mughal (zmughal) for
diagnosing the problem, developing the fix, submitting the pull request,
and rattling my cage after I, for reasons inexplicable to me, ignored
all this for a couple weeks. An equivalent (I hope!) test using only
files under my control was added by modifying t/data/_lib/mu.pod to add
an XE<lt>...E<gt> after the AUTHOR entry, which is referred to by
F<t/data/pod_ok/external_installed_pod.pod>.
